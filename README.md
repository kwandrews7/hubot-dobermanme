This is a simple coffeescript to configure hubot to respond with random pictures of dobermans. Hubot-scrips can currently pug you, corgi you, and kitten you, so this seemed like the only logical option for my next hubot-script. As of right now, most of the images are of a friend of mines doberman. I'm happy to add more to the array, if you have any images you would like to add contact me via Github or Twitter @kwandrews7 and send me a publicly hosted URL (I recommend Imgur for hosting).

By sending me any images, you are stating that you have the rights to said images and are granting me permissions to include them in the doberman me hubot-script.

Thanks and enjoy!

### 0.0.1

* It's a doberman me hubot script. What more could you ask for?
